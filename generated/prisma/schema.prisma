/**
 * The generator block in Prisma schema defines how Prisma will generate the Prisma Client.
 * Prisma Client is an auto-generated, type-safe database client that allows you to
 * interact with your database using JavaScript or TypeScript.
 * The client generator is responsible for generating the Prisma Client for your project.
 * This client provides a set of methods (such as findMany, findUnique, create, update,
 * delete, etc.) to query your database in a type-safe manner.

// in prisma, if after running "npx prisma migrate dev" and seeing our migration.sql in
// migration > prisma folder, the databse is updated in neon or whatever databse you 
// are using, you will have to run "npx prisma migrate dev" everytime a new change is made 
// in your User Model, and a migration.sql file will be created defining those changes.
